# Smokeball – Test Development Project

To gain a better understanding of your technical, design and logic skills, we would like you to create a project in C#.NET that will perform the following: 
 
TASK 
 
The CEO from Smokeball is very interested in SEO and how this can improve sales. Every morning he logs in to google.com.au and types in the same key words “conveyancing software” and counts down to see where and how many times their company www.smokeball.com.au sits on the list. 
Seeing the CEO do this every day, a smart software developer at Smokeball decides to write a small application for him that will automatically perform this operation and return the result to the screen. 
They design and code some software that receives a string of keywords and does a search of Google. The result is then processed to return a string of numbers for the position(s) that the company URL is found in Google search. For example, “1, 10, 33” or “0”. 
The CEO is only interested if their URL appears in the first 100 results.
